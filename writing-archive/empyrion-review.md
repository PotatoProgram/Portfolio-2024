<h1>So close, and yet so far</h1>
I had high hopes for this game. It looked like it had the other half of what I was missing in Space Engineers. And for 20 hours, I had it. Granted, it was with the Reforged Eden mod (which was referred to as a "scenario" in the game for reasons I'll probably touch on later), but it was still exactly what I was looking for (kind of). I took a break when another unrelated game entered my rotation and kinda shoved this one out, but I came back today (as of writing) with a fresh install of Windows (long story, tl;dr is boot file shenanigans) and by extension, a fresh install of the game, and lost the magic immediately.
<h2>True First Impressions</h2>

The following refers to my memory of first launching the game, NOT the reinstall interactions
The first thing I noticed was just how <i>clunky</i> everything felt. This is a 2020 game (according to Steam anyway, I have my doubts) and yet the menu is literally just a static image. I know that resources can be limited and dev stuff can affect literally everything when you least expect it, but this still set the vibes WAY off and is something that bothers me. I won't say any more on the matter, since I feel it goes into stuff I'm not qualified to have opinions on (namely, project scale things like budget and team size), but at least add some music or SOMETHING to the menus.
After working through the menus to get my settings in order (which was a pain in itself because the game did NOTHING to auto-detect settings and set them all to the max, as well as a fight with some frankly antiquated habits regarding resolution and fullscreen settings, but I digress), I started a vanilla save, since the RE page recommended that players of the mod be at least familiar with the game's mechanics. I spent about five minutes in there (which I will admit was probably not enough time) and very eagerly went and installed RE. This five-minute session was so because of the game's abysmal tutorial setup. Judging from what I can remember of it, it was either incredibly forgettable or downright bad, because what I can remember is a bunch of Youtube videos on the subject, and not short ones either. No integrated tutorials here, you gotta take 15 minutes out of your day so you can learn to walk. This was incredibly discouraging and insanely inaccessible, because (and I hate to bring disabilities into the picture because it feels like a copout for some reason) for someone with ADHD like me, non-integrated tutorials like that are extremely hard to focus on since I quite simply cannot sit still for that long (which is why I heavily prefer games over any other media). As a result of all of this (or some other roadblock prevented me from completing the tutorial, on the off chance I just ranted about something that doesn't exist there lol). I went into RE blind.
<h3>The Reforged Experience</h3>
Instantly upon rebooting with RE installed, I got confused. Something that the other reviews don't mention is that RE is not a "mod" like you normally expect from the Workshop, but is actually a "scenario" that you have to specifically select when making a new save. This was annoying, and that feeling only got worse as I interacted with it more. The lack of proper mod status had a few consequences:
1. You CANNOT, even if the scenario only flips some numbers around or changes what you start with, use an existing save file with the modded content. This was a minor inconvenience for me as I had prepared the aforementioned vanilla save to be a throwaway with not much to lose if necessary, but it was still something I noted.
2. You can't mix and match mods to make a completely tailored experience (which is what I thought mods were for but here we are). This is a separate point from the one above because I ran into several details that I didn't really like about RE that were more "problems with the base game not playing nice with the content" than the mod itself, and I painfully ran into this roadblock every time I went onto the workshop looking for a fix.
Other than that, the mod was EXCELLENT for what it was working with.
<h2>The Great Reinstallation</h2>

Up until now, I've been discussing the game on an extremely basic level. The reason for this was because the sheer magic of the potential "space engineers but good" properties of the game were obscuring some of the details that probably should have been red flags.
<h3>The Mechanics</h3>
Space Engineers takes a <i>very</i> hard sci-fi approach to logistics. If you can't connect it with a conveyor, the two containers might as well be on another planet if you want them to interact in any meaningful way. Empyrion takes a different approach. It's quite simple: if you are on the vessel it belongs to, you can access it from anywhere. This works, and honestly its more of a "sidegrade" to space engineers in that aspect (you win some, you lose some and whatnot), so I won't dock EGS for that. What WAS frustrating, though, was the system that restricts what you can put where. Space Engineers just doesn't care what you put down and where, but if you try to place a solar array on a hover craft in EGS, the game simply won't let you, which is inconvenient at best and wastes a TON of time gathering resources at worst.
<h3>The Graphics</h3>
This is one of the two definitively-identifiable killers of the game for me. The worlds look alright. Its no Satisfactory or Elite Dangerous, but it'll work. The character models, on the other hand, look ugly as sin. On max settings, they're beaten by SOURCE 1 MODELS. Valve makes (or made) good games, but, at least in my eyes, they've always struggled with human models in Source 1, so to see a game made in 2020 look worse than 2007 graphics is a damn shame. It only gets worse as you go down, on both ends. When the game started running at a playable fps (which i'll get to in a minute) the game looked exactly like I was expecting the "low" settings to be in all of the worst ways. Low-res textures on weirdly-proportioned models (could have been my character but that would signal ANOTHER problem with the game), and landscapes that look like someone mowed the lawn of the entire planet down to 1cm, but badly, leaving errant patches of grass around. This was on something around medium to high settings, so I can't imagine what it looked like below that. Is it even playable?
<h3>The Performance Issues. Oh God the Performance Issues</h3>
I have a medium-end PC. No 3090s, no latest-gen stuff, just a humble little $500 prebuilt from 2019. She punches above her weight incredibly well, and could run Satisfactory (pre-U8 due to the engine upgrade) at 60fps until about Tier 6, where it started to consistently run at 30fps, but usually no lower.
I went on that tangent to say that this game SHOULD NOT be running as slow as it does. I can tolerate 30fps and above, since the human eye only starts truly perceiving frame drops below 28fps, but something that looks like if Mario 64 was a space sandbox should NOT be running at &lt20fps CONSISTENTLY on a modern system. This wasn't RE causing this either, because my foray into the game today was on a vanilla save (with no changes to the graphics settings, I might add, which tells me that the game is either lacking a benchmarking system or is horribly unoptimized, and I've seen some pretty damning things regarding the latter).
On a system with 32GB of RAM with a Radeon RX 580 graphics card, 4GB of VRAM (which i know is not a lot but i need to include it for transparency and to prove my point), I was getting "low memory detected" errors and a consistent &lt28fps. I more than meet the recommended specs, so why doesn't the performance reflect that?

This game had me in the palm of its hand. I came to it begging for Space Engineers, and it delivered a sweet high of the space sandbox drug. Once I stepped away, I could truly see it for what it was: a colossal wasted opportunity
