Now, I haven't played in a while, but with how the game is developed, I can't say I would be surprised if the game was almost exactly the same as when I stopped playing it.

This game is made for a very specific type of player, and I'm not that player. The main selling point of this game is that you can make very intricate designs that do **exactly** what you want them to do. The problem I have with this is that you have to literally write programming for the things to do the epic scifi thing. The game doesn't hold your hand on this, either. It literally gives you an empty text box and lets you at it. The game also advertises realism, which it does pretty well, to a point, but that also includes logistics for materials (I have issues with those too, but more on that later) and oxygen. The vast majority of your capital ship (which you will probably spend hours building, but that's just me) will be conveyor belts.

Now on to the gameplay that everyone will experience. 
The UI is awful. Especially in the survival mode, which seems to be where everyone spends their time, its not clear how inventory works. For those who don't know, its weight based, but the UI would have you believe that you have 8 slots to put stacks of items. After you finally figure that out, its time to start digging. But you can't access your drill! And going into the inventory, where its located, doesn't do anything either. This is because you have to GO INTO THE BUILD MENU to put it on your hotbar, because if you hold it, its done through the build menu. 
The survival mode is lackluster. Pretty much the only difference between survival and creative modes is the jetpack fuel, a suit battery (which I can't even remember the purpose of??), and health. That, and the grind. Early game is a slog, so much so that I can't even force myself to make it to the mid-game. The entire first part of the game is "drill, refine, (maybe) expand your base, repeat" for a REALLY long time. 
And the creative mode STILL manages to feel like you're missing half the game.
The motivation in both modes is, like the game's slogan says, is PURELY "powered by the need to create", and there's no reason to continue upgrading your stuff at the beginning of the game. 
Logistics are a pain. Like I said before, the conveyors will occupy a large portion of your capital ship, and there's no reason to use the tube conveyors except to make your ship look nicer. Also, small tube conveyors can't carry larger items, and certain things that would make sense to be able to be transported through the small conveyors can't be transported because they're too large.

Another thing I have with this game is the *terrible* development style. This game is ENTIRELY supported by the passionate modding community, props to them for sticking with this game even after it came out of what I understand to be a glorious early access. You can even see it in their community highlights posts. They see mods that fix glaring issues with the game and feature the mod that fixes them instead of fixing it themselves. The only thing the devs seem to be interested in is making more DLC-locked blocks to make more money, because QoL doesn't increase profits. 
There's a reason why they sell this in packs of 4 on the Steam page. The game is also majorly supported by its multiplayer community, 99% of which still play with mods, and a ton of them at that. I played on a server that had a 2 GIGABYTE mod list. It took me like 30 minutes to log in *every single time* because of the update checks it had to do. If you're wondering how that's slamming the devs, its because, even with the mods, early game was STILL as much of a slog as before.

So no, I can't recommend this game to other people, because TL;DR, devs have awful business practices and the game is boring
