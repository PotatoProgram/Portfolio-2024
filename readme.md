## Approach

I decided to place my "login" form at the end of the other "interactive" parts of my website. This integrated it nicely in a way I appreciated. <br>
I didn't initially design the form to integrate well with the website, at all, since the website wasn't designed for it, so the changes probably feel tacked-on in places.

## Challenges
The big one was the fact that I had no idea (or completely forgot [to a point where I couldn't tell if we ever discussed it in class]) how to parse forms without using jQuery, and most of my searches on how to do so turned up fruitless. <br>
I did eventually find documentation for it, but it was in the middle of a "data validation" example, and with no other place to look, I had no other choice than to use it. If there's a more efficient way to do form data in DOM, I couldn't find it.
