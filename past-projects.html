        For what little I knew of programming, my freshman self was very
        promising. It was a mirror of a companion tool for a game I played that
        worked rather well.

        At the end of my junior year's first semester, I had grown leaps and
        bounds from where I started. I made a small dictionary of commonly used
        tone indicators online.

        The site you are viewing right now is one that I made for a "portfolio" project, originally created in my junior year of high school. It has since been updated, although when it was last updated is either a really easy or very good question, depending on how long ago May 2025 was for you. <a href="https://github.com/PotatoProgram/Portfolio-2024/tree/main">[Repository Link]</a>

        I was the lead on a BPA Website Design team. I coordinated the work,
        styling, and content of the site in a team of 3 other people. Although
        we did not advance beyond the regional competition, we still placed 6th
        overall at said event.

        Another earlier project, this was one of my first "challenge"
        assignments for my high school Web Development course. I was instructed
        to create a website for my intended career path.

        <p class="col-8 gallery-text">This one was an assignment from my first introduction to Bootstrap, and is a much simpler, more proof-of-concept site than anything. I understood Bootstrap much less at the time, but I have only gotten better since then. <a href="https://github.com/PotatoProgram/CodeHS_Interaction-Challenge">[Repository Link]</a></p>
