          For what little I knew of programming, my freshman self was very
          promising. It was a mirror of a companion tool for a game I played
          that worked rather well. <a href="https://github.com/PotatoProgram/EDFleetCarrierCalculator">[Repository Link]</a>

          At the end of my junior year's first semester, I had grown leaps and
          bounds from where I started. I made a small dictionary of commonly
          used tone indicators online. <a href="https://github.com/PotatoProgram/html-project-css">

          This site was my final exam in my junior year. It was developed
          entirely from scratch, with only some assistance from libraries like
          Bootstrap, and, depending on which site you are viewing right now, the
          typewriter effect script.

        <p class="col-8 gallery-text">I was the lead on a BPA Website Design team. I coordinated the work, styling, and content of the site in a team of 3 other people. Although we did not advance beyond the regional competition, we still placed 6th overall at said event. <a href="https://github.com/PotatoProgram/BPA-2023">[Repository Link]</a> </p>
