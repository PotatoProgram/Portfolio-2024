      <p class="col-8 gallery-text">A project that was worked on throughout the course of the 2024-25 school year. It uses several APIs to pull weather data and present it in a easily digestible manner. There are some rather unserious aspects of it that were included to make its status as a school assignment more bearable, but nothing directly impacting the site function.<a href="https://github.com/PotatoProgram/weather-app">[Repository Link]</a></p>

        The site you are viewing right now is one that I made for a "portfolio"
        project, originally created in my junior year of high school. It has
        since been updated, although when it was last updated is either a really
        easy or very good question, depending on how long ago May 2025 was for
        you.

        I was the lead on a BPA Website Design team in 2024. I coordinated the work,
        styling, and content of the site in a team of 3 other people. Although
        we did not advance beyond the regional competition, we still placed 6th
        overall at said event.
