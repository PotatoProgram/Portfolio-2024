        A project that was worked on throughout the course of the 2024-25 school
        year. It uses several APIs to pull weather data and present it in a
        easily digestible manner. There are some rather unserious aspects of it
        that were included to make its status as a school assignment more
        bearable, but nothing directly impacting the site function.

        The site you are viewing right now is one that I made for a "portfolio"
        project, originally created in my junior year of high school. It has
        since been updated, although when it was last updated is either a really
        easy or very good question, depending on how long ago May 2025 was for
        you.

        I was the lead on a BPA Website Design team in 2023. I coordinated the
        work, styling, and content of the site in a team of 3 other people.
        Although we did not advance beyond the regional competition, we still
        placed 6th overall at said event.

        While I was not the lead on the project (at least in an official
        capacity), I did work on an entry for the 2024 BPA competition. While we
        did not place at the competition, several aspects show immense growth
        from myself and my team members. This site included scripting, several
        new information delivery methods, and an overall more coherent design
        than the last year.

        Even looking back on this project 4 years later, I am shocked that it
        was <em>this</em> well put together. This was my first true foray into
        making something without a theme or instruction manual to guide me. I
        had to teach myself how to use the DOM with JavaScript, as well as
        finding ways to get the form to be laid out and submit correctly. While
        my projects of today are far superior in terms of quality, visual
        appeal, and the following of code conventions, the ability to self-teach
        on display here was, and still is, incredible.

        You may have noticed that I write on occasion. While not my most
        professional of work, and definitely not my devoted career path (at
        least, right now), I do have a few game reviews on Steam that I am
        rather proud of. I have created a copy of them in a file in this
        repository, so no need to worry about finding my Steam profile. [They
        can be viewed

          I made a small, goofy little survey as an assessment of my ability to
          store data inputted by a user (there are 3 "endings" should you choose
          to take a look)

          A short foray into jQuery, this project had a simple animation that

          I made a small website that simply saves an "active" box that was
          selected on a previous visit and applies it to future ones.

          As a show of my new knowledge of CSS and HTML, I created a simple
          "dictionary" for different indication shorthands for tone that I see
          used online.

          I made a auto-generating "quilt" that changes each tile to a random
          color when the mouse hovers over it. I even went above and beyond the
          project specifications because I really only needed to make it
          randomly select from a group of 4 predetermined colors.
